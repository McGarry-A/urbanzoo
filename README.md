# UZ Code Test

## Task

Create a players page by importing `data/player-data.js`, it should show in a responsive grid, with each player card styled and with a hover state.

Display the data for each player as you see fit.

Add a team selector component to the page using data from `data/page-data.js`, this should change which teams data is shown.

Use the available Sass files and Page Data where you deem necessary.

Please publish this as a repo that can then be shared.# urbanzoo
